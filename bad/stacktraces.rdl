Runtime error: Division by zero

-- Why (read from bottom to top):

Definition Stacktrace:
1. divInt#1            -- the error was thrown by partially applied divInt
2. f#0                 -- the error was thrown from inside of f
3. let expression      -- x was defined in let expression

Evaluation stacktrace:
1. divInt#1            -- the error was thrown by partially applied divInt
2. f#0                 -- the error was thrown by evaluation of f
3. manual deep force   -- manual deep force of lazy thunk
4. deepForced#0        -- argument of g was manually forced at this moment
5. g#0                 -- g is called
6. let evaluation      -- let's "in" is evaluated
7. let expression      -- enter let expression
8. main                -- call main
